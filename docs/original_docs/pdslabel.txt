    PDS labels are object-oriented.  The object to which the label
refers (e.g. IMAGE, TABLE, etc.) is denoted by a statement of the form:

    ^object = location

in which the carat character (^, also called a pointer in this context)
indicates that the object starts at the given location.  In an embedded
label, the location is an integer representing the starting record
number of the object (the first record in the file is record 1).  In a
detached label, the location denotes the name of the file containing the
object, along with the starting record or byte number if there is more
than one object.  For example:

    ^IMAGE_HEADER = ("XXXXX.IMG",1)
    ^IMAGE = ("XXXXX.IMG",3)

indicates that the IMAGE object begins at record 3 of the file XXXXX.IMG,
in the same directory as the detached label file.  Below is an example
taken from a pds label on this disc showing the ^object definitions.

    ^IMAGE = ("XXXXX.IMG",n)
    ^IMAGE_HEADER = ("XXXXX.IMG",n)
    ^TELEMETRY_TABLE = ("XXXXX.IMG",n)
    ^BAD_DATA_VALUES_HEADER = ("XXXXX.IMG",n)
    ^IMAGE = ("XXXXX.IMG",n)
    ^LINE_PREFIX_TABLE = ("XXXXX.IMG",n)
    ^LINE_PREFIX_STRUCTURE = "RLINEPRX.FMT"
    ^DESCRIPTION = "VICAR2.TXT"
    ^STRUCTURE = "RTLMTAB.FMT"
    ^DESCRIPTION = "BADDATA.TXT"


where

    n is the starting byte number of the object, counting from
        the beginning of the file (record 1, byte 1)

    XXXXX.IMG is the upper-case file name

    RTLMTAB.FMT, RLINEPRX.FMT, VICAR2.TXT, BADDATA.TXT are 
    format files describing the structure of the objects
